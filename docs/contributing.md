# Contributing

The Negative Development documentation is an open-source project that relies on community contributions. 
Whether you want to fix a typo, improve clarity, or add entirely new sections, your help is greatly appreciated.

## How to contribute

You can pull the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/JClique/NegDevDocs), make changes, and submit a pull request. 
If you are unfamiliar with GitHub or prefer another method, we also accept suggestions and improvements via our [contact page](https://negativedevelopment.co.uk/pages/contact).

## How to write

Docs are written in Markdown and built with VitePress, so all typical Markdown syntax is valid. 
VitePress extras, such as custom containers and enhanced linking, can also be used.

Where necessary, we use inline custom Vue components to offer complex calculators or interactive learning materials. 
These components are stored in the repository and can be referenced or extended as needed.


### General structure

The docs consist of an Introduction, three sections; Analogue photography, Film developing, Darkroom printing. 
Followed by a List of Illustrations page, an Appending and a Glossary.

### Tone of voice 
- Be concise — keep sentences clear and to the point. Avoid unnecessary complexity.
- Ensure high levels of readability — use plain language and break up long paragraphs where needed.
- Maintain a neutral and informative tone — aim for clarity over persuasion. The goal is to educate and guide the reader.
- Use an inclusive and welcoming approach — write with the assumption that readers may be new to analogue photography or film developing. Avoid jargon where possible, and define technical terms in the glossary when necessary.
- Keep instructions actionable — where guidance is given, make steps clear and easy to follow.

### Formatting rules

- Headings should be made with navigation in mind. Headings 2 and 3 appear in the right sidebar and can be used for quick navigation. Use sentence case for headings.
- Spelling should follow British English conventions (e.g., *colour film*, not *color film*).
- Use lists, bullet points, text formatting, and imagery where necessary to avoid dense blocks of text.
- Links to glossary entries should not be repeated more than once in the same article.
- All illustrations should be included in the List of Illustrations section, including a paragraph of text to further explain the diagram.

## Versioning

We use a three-decimal versioning system: **major.minor.patch**

- **Patches**: Small corrections and improvements.
- **Minor versions**: New features, additions, and significant refinements.
- **Major versions**: Large structural changes, typically released once or twice per year.

If you are contributing a new feature or a significant revision, consider whether it fits into an upcoming minor or major version update.
For small fixes and refinements, changes can be included in the next patch release.
