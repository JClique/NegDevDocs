# Contributing

The Negative Development documentation is an open-source project that relies on community contributions. 
Whether you want to fix a typo, improve clarity, or add entirely new sections, your help is appreciated.

## How to contribute

You can pull the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/JClique/NegDevDocs), make changes, and submit a pull request. 
If you are unfamiliar with GitHub or prefer another method, we also accept suggestions and improvements via our [contact page](https://negativedevelopment.co.uk/pages/contact).

## How to write

Docs are written in Markdown and built with VitePress, so all typical Markdown syntax is valid. 
VitePress extras, such as custom containers and enhanced linking, can also be used.

Where necessary, we use inline custom Vue components to offer complex calculators or interactive learning materials. 
These components are stored in the repository and can be referenced or extended as needed.

### Formatting rules

- Headings should be created with article navigation in mind. Headings 2 and 3 appear in the right sidebar and can be used for quick navigation. Use sentence case for headings.
- Ensure high levels of readability.
- Be concise.
- Spelling should follow British English conventions (e.g., *colour film*, not *color film*).
- Insert a single newline after each sentence in Markdown, rather than leaving sentences on the same line. Do not add two spaces at the end of a line, as this forces a line break in Markdown.
- Use lists, bullet points, text formatting, and imagery where necessary to avoid dense blocks of text.
- Link to glossary entries the first time a word is mentioned but not repeatedly throughout an article.
- Illustrations should be included in the List of Illustrations whenever they are added to an article. The List of Illustrations entry should include a paragraph of text to further explain the diagram, improving accessibility.

### General structure

The docs consist of an Introduction, three sections; Analogue photography, Film developing, Darkroom printing. 
Followed by a List of Illustrations page, an Appending and a Glossary. 

## Versioning

We use a three-decimal versioning system: **major.minor.patch**

- **Patches**: Small corrections and improvements.
- **Minor versions**: New features, additions, and significant refinements.
- **Major versions**: Large structural changes, typically released once or twice per year.

If you are contributing a new feature or a significant revision, consider whether it fits into an upcoming minor or major version update.
For small fixes and refinements, changes can be included in the next patch release.
