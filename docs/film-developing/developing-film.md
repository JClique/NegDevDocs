# Developing film

Developing your own film is a key part of the analogue process. It gives you full control over how your images look and lets you get involved with the physical side of photography from start to finish. 

[//]: # (There are three common development processes, each suited to different types of film: **black & white**, **C41 colour negative**, and **E6 colour slide**.)

## Black & white process

This is the most forgiving and accessible option, often used by beginners and professionals alike. 
black & white development uses a simple three-step chemistry: developer, stop bath, and fixer. 
It can be done at room temperature, and most films have a bit of flexibility in their timing and technique.

## C41 process

C41 is the standard development process for colour negative film. 
It requires a developer, bleach, fixer, and stabiliser, with precise temperature control—usually around 38°C. 
Many labs use this process, but it can also be done at home with the right setup.

[//]: # (## E6 process)

[//]: # (E6 is used to develop colour slide &#40;transparency&#41; film. )

[//]: # (It’s a multi-step process with tight tolerances and little room for error, involving a first developer, reversal bath, colour developer, bleach, fixer, and stabiliser. )

[//]: # (The results are vivid and detailed positives, ideal for projection or scanning.)
