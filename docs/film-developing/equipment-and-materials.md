# Equipment and materials  

This section covers the essential equipment needed to develop a roll of film by hand, either at home or in a small community darkroom. Beyond these basics, additional tools can help make the process easier or more consistent.  

## Required tools  

### Developing tank  

A developing tank holds the film in a light-proof chamber while allowing developing chemicals to be poured in and out. Tanks are made from either plastic or metal and usually consist of three main parts: the tank, the lid, and the reel (or spiral). The reel holds the film in a coil, allowing the processing chemistry to evenly develop the film's emulsion.  

There are two types of developing tanks: daylight-loading and dark-loading. Daylight-loading tanks allow you to load the film in normal light without exposing it. While this may sound convenient, these tanks have limitations. They typically support only one film format, are rare, and are often more expensive. Dark-loading tanks are cheaper, widely available, and, with a bit of practice, easy to use.  

### Chemistry  

Film developing chemistry is typically available as either a concentrated liquid or a powder. Both must be mixed with water to create a working solution. Each chemical comes with instructions that should be followed exactly.  

In addition to the chemicals, certain tools make handling them easier and more precise. Measuring cylinders ensure accurate mixing, bottles allow for storage between sessions, and funnels help prevent spills. Plastic is cheap and easy to find, but metal and glass are easier to keep clean and usually last longer.  

### Temperature measurement and control  

For most black and white film development, precise temperature control is not essential. The process is typically carried out at 20°C, and small variations can be compensated for. A digital thermometer is the best tool for measuring temperature accurately.  

For processes that require more precise temperature control, solutions must be maintained above ambient room temperature. This can be done by immersing the processing chemicals in a warm water bath and monitoring the temperature throughout development.  

### Changing bag  

When using a dark-loading developing tank, the film must be transferred onto the reel in complete darkness to prevent exposure. While a dark cupboard or windowless room may work, a changing bag is a far safer and more convenient option.  

To use a changing bag, insert the roll of film and the developing tank through the large opening at the bottom, zip it shut, and insert your hands through the sleeves. This allows you to transfer the film to the tank safely. Avoid wearing watches or devices that emit light inside the bag.  

## Helpful tools  

These additional tools are recommended, even for a first attempt at film development. They make the process easier and are generally inexpensive and long-lasting.  

### Clips and hooks  

Once processed, the film must be hung up to dry. Specialised film-piercing clips are ideal, but simple wooden pegs can be used in a pinch. Avoid metal bulldog clips, as they can rust and damage the film’s emulsion.  

### Leader retriever  

For 35mm film, the aluminium canister can be torn open inside a changing bag, but using a leader retriever beforehand is easier and safer. This tool allows the film to be retrieved through the canister’s opening, avoiding sharp metal edges inside the changing bag.  

### Scissors  

Scissors are useful when developing 35mm film, as the leader must be cut off before loading the film onto the reel. They can also help inside the changing bag to cut the film free from the canister.  

### Safety equipment  

Gloves and an apron help ensure safe handling of chemicals during processing. Fixers and bleaches, in particular, can stain clothes if not handled properly.  

## Luxury tools  

### Film developing processor  

A film developing processor automates the development process, ensuring consistent results with minimal effort. While not essential, it can be a valuable tool for those who develop film regularly.  

### Film drying cabinet  

A film drying cabinet provides a dust-free environment for drying film. This helps prevent dust and water spots from ruining negatives, making it a useful addition to any darkroom setup.
