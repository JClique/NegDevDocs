# Equipment and materials 

Developing film by hand requires a few essential tools. 
Beyond the basics, additional equipment can make the process easier, more consistent, or more enjoyable.

## Required tools 

### Developing tank 

A developing tank holds the film in a **light-proof chamber**, allowing chemicals to be poured in and out without exposing the film. 
Tanks are typically plastic or metal and consist of three parts: 

- **Tank** – the main body that holds the film and chemistry 
- **Lid** – seals the tank to prevent light leaks 
- **Reel (or spiral)** – holds the film in a coil for even chemical distribution 

There are two types of tanks: 

- **Dark-loading tanks** – require film to be loaded in complete darkness but are widely available, inexpensive, and compatible with multiple film formats. 
- **Daylight-loading tanks** – allow loading in normal light but are rare, more expensive, and usually support only one format.

### Chemistry 

Film developing chemistry is sold as either a concentrated liquid or a powder. 
Both must be mixed with water to create a working solution. 
Each chemical comes with instructions that should be followed exactly. 

In addition to the chemicals, these tools make handling them easier and more precise:

- **Measuring cylinders** – ensure accurate mixing 
- **Storage bottles** – keep mixed solutions fresh 
- **Funnels** – prevent spills when transferring liquids

### Temperature measurement and control 

Most **black & white films** are developed at **20°C**, with minor variations being manageable. 
However, other processes like C41 and E6 require strict temperature control. 

- A **digital thermometer** provides precise readings. 
- For temperature-sensitive processes, chemicals can be kept warm by placing bottles in a **water bath** and monitoring the temperature. 

### Changing bag 

A changing bag provides a **light-tight space** for loading film, which is necessary when using a dark-loading developing tank.
Changing bags are a safer and more convenient alternative to using a dark room or cupboard. 


## Helpful tools 

These tools are not essential but make film development **easier and more efficient**. 

### Clips and hooks 

Once developed, film must dry. 
Clips help secure the film to either a hook, or line of string mounted high enough the film can dry safely. 

- **Film clips** – designed to pierce film for secure hanging 
- **Wooden pegs** – a simple alternative 

::: warning 
Avoid metal bulldog clips which can rust over time and damage film. Some stainless steel clips designed for film can be used as long as they remain clean and rust-free.

### Leader retriever 

For **35mm film**, the film leader can be retrieved with a **leader retriever**, avoiding the need to tear open the metal canister in a changing bag. 

### Scissors 

Scissors are useful for: 
- Cutting off the film **leader** before loading onto the reel 
- **Trimming** film inside the changing bag 

### Safety equipment 

- **Gloves** – protect hands from chemicals 
- **Apron** – prevents fixer and bleach stains on clothing 

## Luxury tools 

For those who develop film frequently, these tools provide extra convenience and precision. 

### Film developing processor 

A film developing processor automates the development process, ensuring **consistent results** with minimal effort. 

### Film drying cabinet 

A film drying cabinet provides a **dust-free environment**, preventing dust and water spots from ruining negatives.
