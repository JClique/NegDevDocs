# Black & white process

## 1. Develop

The first step is to develop the film. Converting the latent image held in the silver halides of your film emulation to metallic silver to create a negative image. The areas exposed to the most light energy will form the densest areas of metallic silver. The areas not exposed to light will form no metallic silver at all. They will remain silver halides to be removed later. 

The developing time of black & white film is influenced by your developer choice, its strength and temperature, and the film to be developed. In most cases, each emulsion must be developed separately. That is to say, a roll of Ilford HP5+ and a roll of Kodak Tri-X cannot typically be developed in the same tank, as the developing times for these two films will likely be different.

#### Starting time

First, you must find the starting time for your combination of developer and film stock. Most films contain a table of starting times for the most popular developers inside the film box itself. Larger film manufacturers such as [Ilford](https://www.ilfordphoto.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Film-processing-chart-.pdf), publish documentation on most combinations of their developers and emulsions. 

If no developing times can be found for your combination of film and developer, this can be estimated by doing a development test [^1]. Dip a test strip of film into working strength developer and time how long it takes for the exposed film to turn completely dark. Divide the time by three to get the number of minutes required to develop this film.

For example; If it takes 17.02 seconds to turn the film strip dark, divide this by 3 to get 5.67, which gives you a 5-minute and 40-second starting developing time. 

#### Temperature

Starting development times are based on your chemistry being 20Â° C however it is not strictly required for black & white development. 

==TODO: How to adjust development time based on temperature==

Measure the temperature of your developer solution and adjust your time to compensate. Ilford has published a time compensation chart which can be used to adjust developing times to account for a few degrees 

#### Agitation

To ensure the development occurs evenly, the solution must be agitated regularly allowing fresh chemistry to reach the film emulsion. When developing with a tank agitation is performed by inverting the tank for 15 seconds every minute. This amount of agitation requires no change to your development time. 

Extra agitation can increase the rate of development, which can cause increased contrast in your negatives. To compensate for this when using continuous rotary processors it is recommended to reduce your development time by 15%.  


## 2. Stop

Once the film is developed for the desired time, empty the tank of developing solution and replace it with a stop bath. This citric acid solution shifts the pH of the film emulsion and abruptly stops the developing process. 

Generally speaking, a minute of stop bath with around 15 seconds of agitation throughout should be enough to adequately stop the development using a fresh stop bath solution. 

While not strictly necessary, a stop bath can increase the lifespan of your fixer solution by preventing cross-contamination from the developer. If no stop bath is available several rinses of water can be used in its place. 


## 3. Fix

Fixer is used to remove all remaining unexposed silver halide crystals from the film. These silver halides will be exposed if the film is removed from the developing tank before being thoroughly fixed. This appears as a cloudy fog in the clear areas of your negatives and will disperse if kept in the fixer solution long enough.
