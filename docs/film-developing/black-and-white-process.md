# Black & white film development

This guide covers the step-by-step process of developing black & white film. 
The process consists of three main stages: **developing**, **stopping**, and **fixing**.

## 1. Develop

The first step is to develop the film, turning the latent image into a visible negative. 

This is done by converting the exposed [silver halide crystals](/glossary#silver-halide-crystals) into metallic silver. 
The metallic silver absorbs light and appears black, creating a negative of the light areas of the scene. 

- **Light exposure & density** 
  - Areas that received more light become denser with metallic silver. 
  - Areas that received no light remain as silver halides, which will be removed later. 

### Development time & temperature 

Development time depends on: 
- The type of **developer** used (strength & formula). 
- The **temperature** of the chemicals. 
- The **film stock** being developed. 

::: tip **Note:** 
Since different films have unique development times, mixing different emulsions in the same tank is usually not recommended.

### Recommended developing times

1. **Manufacturer recommendations** 

Many film boxes include a table with development times for common developers.
Major brands like [Ilford](https://www.ilfordphoto.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Film-processing-chart-.pdf) provide online processing guides. 

2. **Film developing calculator**

Our [film developing calculator](/appendix/black-and-white-film-developing-time-calculator) provides precise times for a wide range of film & developer combinations.
It also adjusts for *temperature variations* and optimizes for *rotary processors, speed, or grain structure*. 

3. **Estimating development time manually** 

If no official time is available, you can perform a [development test](/appendix/black-and-white-film-developing-manual-test).

### Adjusting for temperature 

Most development times are based on a standard **20Â°C** solution temperature.
However, temperature adjustments may be necessary. 

- **Measure** the temperature of your developer. 
- **Adjust** your time using a compensation chart. 
- Ilford provides a [time compensation chart](https://www.ilfordphoto.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Temperature-compensation-chart.pdf) for minor temperature variations. 

::: tip **Tip:**
Our [black & white film developing time calculator](/appendix/black-and-white-film-developing-time-calculator) will adjust the developing times based on the given temperature, and even warn you when your developer may be too hot!

### Agitation technique 

Regular agitation ensures even development by moving fresh chemistry over the film surface. 

- **Standard tank development:** 
  - Invert the tank for **15 seconds every minute**. 
  - No adjustment to development time is needed. 

- **Rotary processors:** 
  - Agitation speeds up development and can lead to increased contrast if excessive.
  - When using **continuous rotary processors**, reduce development time by **15%**. 

## 2. Stop

Once development is complete, the process must be stopped immediately to prevent overdevelopment. 
This is done using a **stop bath** or water rinse. 
Stop bath is often a **citric acid solution** which lowers the pH, halting development and extending the life of the fixer by reducing contamination.

### Stop time & temperature 

- Standard time: **1 minute** for fresh stop bath
- Required temperature: similar to developer
- Agitation: **Continuous or 10 seconds every 30 seconds** 

Alternatively if no stop bath is available, multiple rinses of clean water can be used. 

## 3. Fix

Fixing removes unexposed silver halide crystals from the film, making the negative stable and light-safe.
If the film is exposed to light before being fixed, the remaining silver halides will become exposed. 
This appears as a **cloudy fog** in the clear areas of the negative.

### Fix time & temperature

- Standard time: **5â€“7 minutes**, depending on the fixerâ€™s strength
- Required temperature: similar to developer
- Agitation: **Continuous or 10 seconds every 30 seconds** 

If fogging appears after fixing, the negatives can be re-fixed to clear the remaining halides.
