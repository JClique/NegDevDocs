# Black & white film development

This guide covers the step-by-step process of developing black & white film. 
The process consists of three main stages: **developing**, **stopping**, and **fixing**.

## 1. Develop

The first step is to develop the film, turning the latent image into a visible negative. 
This is done by converting the exposed [silver halide crystals](/glossary#silver-halide-crystals) into metallic silver. 
The metallic silver absorbs light and appears black, creating a negative of the light areas of the scene. 

- **Light exposure & density**  
  - Areas that received more light become denser with metallic silver.  
  - Areas that received no light remain as silver halides, which will be removed later.  

### Choosing the right development time  

Development time depends on:  
- The type of **developer** used (strength & formula).  
- The **temperature** of the chemicals.  
- The **film stock** being developed.  

Since different films have unique development times, mixing different emulsions in the same tank is usually not recommended.  

#### Finding the correct time  

1. **Manufacturer recommendations**  
   - Many film boxes include a table with development times for common developers.  
   - Major brands like [Ilford](https://www.ilfordphoto.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Film-processing-chart-.pdf) provide online processing guides.  

2. **Use our [film developing calculator](/appendix/black-and-white-film-developing-time-calculator)**  
   - Our **film developing calculator** provides precise times for a wide range of **film & developer combinations**.  
   - It also adjusts for **temperature variations** and optimizes for **rotary processors, speed, or grain structure**.  


3. **Estimating development time manually**  
   If no official time is available, you can perform a **development test**:  
   - Cut a test strip of film and immerse it in the developer.  
   - Time how long it takes to turn completely dark.  
   - Divide this time by **three** to estimate the full development time.  

   **Example:**  
   - If a film strip darkens in **17.02 seconds**, divide by **3** â†’ **5 minutes 40 seconds** is the estimated development time.  

#### Adjusting for temperature  

Most development times are based on a standard **20Â°C** solution temperature. However, temperature adjustments may be necessary.  

- **Measure** the temperature of your developer.  
- **Adjust** your time using a compensation chart.  
- Ilford provides a [time compensation chart](https://www.ilfordphoto.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Temperature-compensation-chart.pdf) for minor temperature variations.

#### Agitation technique  

Regular agitation ensures even development by moving fresh chemistry over the film surface.  

- **Standard tank development:**  
  - Invert the tank for **15 seconds every minute**.  
  - No adjustment to development time is needed.  

- **Increased agitation:**  
  - Increases development speed and contrast.  
  - If using **continuous rotary processors**, reduce development time by **15%**.

## 2. Stop

Once development is complete, the process must be stopped immediately to prevent overdevelopment. This is done using a **stop bath** or water rinse.  

### Using a stop bath  

- A **citric acid solution** lowers the pH, halting development.  
- Recommended time: **1 minute** with **15 seconds of agitation**.  

### Alternative: Water rinse  

- If no stop bath is available, multiple rinses of clean water can be used.  
- However, a stop bath extends the life of the fixer by reducing contamination.  

## 3. Fix

Fixing removes unexposed silver halide crystals from the film, making the negative stable and light-safe.  

### Why fixing is essential  

- If the film is exposed to light before being fixed, remaining silver halides will darken.  
- This appears as a **cloudy fog** in the clear areas of the negative.  
- Proper fixing ensures these halides dissolve completely.
