# Scanning film

Scanning film is a common step in the modern analogue workflow, allowing you to digitise negatives for editing, digital printing, or sharing online. 
While it is possible to remain fully analogue and work exclusively in the darkroom without ever digitising your negatives, scanning can still be a useful tool for previewing images and planning your printing session.


## Lab scanning

Many film labs offer scanning services as part of their developing packages. 
This is a convenient option if you want high-quality scans without investing in specialised equipment.

### Types of lab scanners

Labs use professional-grade scanners designed for speed and consistency. The most common types include:

- **Noritsu/Fuji Frontier** – These are automated minilab scanners known for their fast processing and balanced colour rendition. They work well for standard 35mm and 120 film.
- **Drum scanners** – These provide the highest quality scans with extreme detail and dynamic range but are expensive and time-consuming.
- **Imacon/Hasselblad Flextight** – A hybrid between flatbed and drum scanners, these offer excellent sharpness and tonal depth.
  
**Pros of lab scanning:**
- Quick and convenient.
- No need for additional equipment or software.

**Cons of lab scanning:**
- Can be costly, especially for high-resolution scans.
- Quality varies depending on the lab's equipment and operator.

## Home scanning

Scanning film at home provides full control over the final image and can be more cost-effective over time. 
There are two main methods: flatbed scanning and DSLR scanning.

### Flatbed scanning

Flatbed scanners designed for film include built-in transparency units and film holders. 
Popular models include the Epson V600, V800, and the Canon 9000F.

The process generally involves loading one or many strips of cut negatives into a dedicated film holder, which holds the film flat and aligns it correctly on the scanning bed.
Once a pre-scan is complete, multiple frames on the negative strips can be selected and scanned. 
Depending on the scanner or software used, exposure, sharpening and colour corrections can be made to improve the final result. 

In most cases scanners will export a positive image from your negatives in either a TIF or JPEG format, but you may wish to export a DNG file and invert the image yourself. 
This can provide more control over the tones and colours, but will require dedicated software and time. 

### DSLR scanning

DSLR scanning involves using a digital camera with a macro lens to photograph negatives. 
This method requires a light source and a film holder to keep negatives flat, as well as a tripod or copy stand to hold the DSLR parallel with the film holder. 

Once each negative has been photographed digitally the transferred to a computer to be inverted.
The process of inverting a digital negative image to a positive can be difficult, especially for colour negative film, so dedicated software is often necessary.

The costs of the additional equipment and software should be considered when choosing DSLR scanning as an option. 
While some of these costs can be reduced with careful technique and manual processing, the additional time and effort required may make the process less enjoyable.

## Choosing the right method

Each method has trade-offs, so best scanning method depends on your needs:

- **For convenience** → Lab scanning is the simplest option.
- **For affordability** → Flatbed scanning is a cost-effective choice.
- **For ultimate quality at home** → DSLR scanning offers the highest resolution and control.
