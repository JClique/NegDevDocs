# C-41 colour film development

This guide covers the step-by-step process of developing C-41 film.
The process consists of three main stages: **developing**, **bleaching**, and **fixing**.

## 1. Develop

The first step is to develop the film, turning the latent image into a visible negative.

As with black & white film, this is done by converting the exposed [silver halide crystals](/glossary#silver-halide-crystals) into metallic silver. 
The metallic silver absorbs light and appears black, creating a negative of the light areas of the scene. 

**Light exposure & density** 
- Areas that received more light become denser with metallic silver. 
- Areas that received no light remain as silver halides, which will be removed later. 

Unlike black & white film, C-41 developer also contains dye couplers which forms a colour dye around each of the metallic silver grains.
The colour of this dye is the opposite of the colour of light that exposed the film. 

**Colour negatives**
- Areas that received red light form cyan dye
- Areas that received green light form magenta dye
- Areas that received blue light form yellow dye

Through the combination of cyan, magenta and yellow dyes the colours and contrast of the image are formed. 

::: tip **Note:**
While most film produces a **colour negative** when developed using the C-41 process, there are some notable exceptions. 
Ilford's XP2 film is developed using the C-41 process, but produces a black & white negative.

### Development time & temperature 

- Standard time: **3 minutes 15 seconds** 
- Required temperature: **38°C (100.4°F) ± 0.3°C** 
- Any variation in temperature or time can cause **colour shifts**

To prevent colour shifts, use a temperature-controlled water bath for the most consistent results.
These can be made at home using a large sink basin, and a sous vide immersion circulator.

### Agitation technique

Regular agitation ensures even development by moving fresh chemistry over the film surface.

**Standard tank method**: 
- Invert the tank for **15 seconds every minute**. 
- No adjustment to development time is needed.

**Rotary processors:** 
- Agitation speeds up development and can lead to increased contrast if excessive.
- When using **continuous rotary processors**, reduce development time by **15%**.

## 2. Bleach

After development, the **bleach** converts metallic silver back into silver halides, allowing it to be removed in the fixing stage. 
This leaves only the colour dye clouds formed during development, giving the negative a bright and saturated appearance. 
Skipping the bleach step is a technique commonly referred to as [bleach bypass](/glossary#bleach-bypass). 

### Bleach time & temperature 

- Standard time: **6 minutes** 
- Temperature: Not as critical, but keeping it close to **38°C** is ideal
- Agitation: **Continuous or 10 seconds every 30 seconds** 

::: tip Bleach & fix combined
Some C-41 film developing kits come with a combined bleach and fix step, often labeled 'Blix'.
Wherever possible, you should follow the instructions provided by the manufacturer.

## 3. Fix

Fixing removes unexposed silver halide crystals from the film, making the negative stable and light-safe.
If the film is exposed to light before being fixed, the remaining silver halides will become exposed. 
This appears as a **cloudy fog** in the clear areas of the negative.

### Fix time & temperature

- Standard time: **6 minutes seconds**
- Temperature: Not as critical, but keeping it close to **38°C** is ideal
- Agitation: **Continuous or 10 seconds every 30 seconds**

If fogging appears after fixing, the negatives can be re-fixed to clear the remaining halides.
Colour negative film can appear slightly foggy when wet, so drying the film before deciding to re-fix might prevent doing so unnecessarily.

## 4. Stabiliser

The stabiliser prevents colour shifts and fading over time. It contains chemicals that protect the dyes in the emulsion. 

### Stabiliser time & temperature

- Standard time: **1 minute** 
- Temperature: Not as critical, but keeping it close to **38°C** is ideal 
- Agitation: **Continuous or 10 seconds every 30 seconds**
