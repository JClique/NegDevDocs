# Understanding film developing

Film developing is an essential step in the analogue photography process. 
Whether you're processing film at home or using a lab, our guide to understanding the basics will help you achieve the best results. 

## What is film developing?

Film developing is the chemical treatment of exposed film to produce visible images. 
While ‘developing film’ is often used to describe the entire workflow, it is just one step in the overall film processing.

The exact steps depend on the type of film being developed: 

- **Black & white film** requires a developer, stop bath, and fixer. 
- **C41 colour film** follows a process using a colour developer, bleach and fix. 
- **E6 slide film** undergoes multiple development and chemical exposure stages to produce positive transparencies.

Each process is covered in depth within this documentation.  

### Why does film need to be developed?

When light exposes film, it creates a **latent image**—an invisible imprint of the scene. 
Developing film makes this image visible by converting the exposed [silver halides](/glossary#silver-halide-crystals) into metallic silver (for black & white) or forming dye clouds (for colour films). 

Until fully processed, the film remains light-sensitive and can be ruined by accidental exposure to light. 
Fixing the film removes any remaining light-sensitive material, making it stable for long-term storage. 

## How to develop film 

### Developing at home 

Developing film at home (or in a community space like [ours](https://negativedevelopment.co.uk/)!) is straightforward once you understand the process. 
With a few inexpensive tools and the right chemistry, most film types can be developed by hand.

We recommend starting with black & white film, as it is the most forgiving. 
However, C41 and E6 home development kits are also available.

### Developing in a lab 

Even if you choose to use a lab, understanding film developing can be beneficial. 
Labs will select the correct process for your film, but you should specify if you require: 

- **[Pushing or pulling](/glossary#push-pull-processing)** (developing for longer or shorter to adjust exposure) 
- **[Cross processing](/glossary#cross-processing)** (developing in a different chemistry for creative effects) 

Knowing how film is processed allows you to communicate your needs more effectively and understand the results you receive.
