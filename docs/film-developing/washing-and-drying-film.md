# Washing and drying film

Properly washing your film after processing is essential to remove residual chemicals and prevent stains, fading and deterioration that can affect the quality of scans or prints.

## Washing film

### Black & white film

#### Ilford washing method

The **Ilford washing method** conserves water while removing residual chemicals effectively. 
This method involves filling and emptying the developing tank multiple times, with increasing amounts of agitation between refills.

1. Fill the tank with clean water at around 20°C.
2. Invert the tank 5 times and empty.
3. Refill the tank with fresh water, invert 10 times, and empty again.
4. For the final rinse, refill the tank and invert 20 times.

For more information, refer to [Ilford's washing guide](https://www.ilfordphoto.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Reducing-Wash-Water.pdf).  

#### Running water method

If you prefer to wash your film with running water, you can place the film tank under gently running water for 5–10 minutes. 
Ensure the water flow is not too strong, as it may cause uneven washing.  

::: tip Tip 
Using a small amount of wetting agent (such as Kodak Photo-Flo or Ilford Ilfotol) in the final rinse reduces water spots and drying marks.

### Colour film (C-41 and E-6)

Colour film requires thorough washing to prevent chemical staining. 
The recommended method depends on the chemistry used:  

- **Blix-based processes** – Wash for at least 3–5 minutes in running water.  
- **Separate bleach and fix** – Follow manufacturer instructions, but typically requires 6–8 water changes.  

## Drying film

After washing, drying your film properly is essential to prevent damage and ensure good quality negatives. 
Here are some tips for drying your film:

### Hanging your film

- Hang the negatives in a dust-free environment using film clips.
- Avoid touching the emulsion side with your fingers to prevent fingerprints.
- Ensure proper air circulation around the film to allow it to dry evenly.

### Film drying cabinet

A **film drying cabinet** provides a controlled environment for drying negatives without dust or contaminants. These cabinets use a combination of warm air and gentle airflow to dry the film quickly and evenly. They are particularly useful in areas with high humidity or dust.  

You can easily create a basic drying cabinet at home by repurposing an old cabinet or box. Install a low-wattage light bulb (such as a 15-watt incandescent bulb) at the bottom to provide gentle heat. Use a small fan to circulate the air, ensuring that the temperature remains consistent and comfortable for drying.

Ensure the drying cabinet is free from any dust or contaminants, and maintain good airflow to avoid water spots on your negatives.

### Common mistakes to avoid

- **Using water that is too hot or cold** – Sudden temperature changes can cause emulsion damage.  
- **Not washing for long enough** – Residual fixer can lead to fading and deterioration.  
- **Skipping the wetting agent** – Can result in drying marks.
