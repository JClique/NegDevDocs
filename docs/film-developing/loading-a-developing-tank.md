# Loading a developing tank

Daylight-loading tanks often have specific instructions, so this guide focuses on **dark-loading developing tanks**, referred to simply as *developing tanks*. 
These require either a [changing bag](/film-developing/equipment-and-materials#changing-bag) or a **completely dark room** to safely load the film. 

## Retrieving the film

### 35mm film

- Use a [leader retriever](/appendix/how-to-use-a-leader-retriever) to retrieve the leader from inside the canister. 
- Cut it at a **90° angle** to help the film enter the reel smoothly. 
- With **Paterson reels**, you may be able to start loading outside the changing bag. If the film has enough exposed length, you can feed it onto the reel until it reaches the **ball bearings**, which prevent slipping. 

### 120 film

- The [backing paper](/glossary#backing-paper) and film must be separated **entirely in the changing bag**. 
- To make this easier, fold over the backing paper's end when finishing the roll instead of sealing it flush.

## Loading the tank

To load your film safely into the developing tank it is advised you use a changing bag.

**How to use a changing bag:** 

1. Place the film and tank inside. 
2. Zip the bag shut. 
3. Insert your hands through the sleeves. 
4. Load the film onto the reel and into the tank. 

::: warning ⚠ **Don't expose the film!** 
Avoid wearing watches or devices that emit light inside the bag. 
If you must remove your hands before the film is safely loaded, be careful not to allow light in through the sleeve holes.

### Plastic reels

- Load the film from the **outside** by moving the reel sides back and forth. 
- **Avoid buckling or bending** the film. 
- If the film comes free from the track, **rewind the film and start again**. 

::: tip 
With **Paterson reels**, you may be able to start loading outside the changing bag. 
If the film has enough exposed length, feed it onto the reel until it reaches the **ball bearings**, which prevent the film from slipping.
Carefully place the film in your changing bag and use the back-and-forth motion of the patterson reel to advance the film along the reel. 
:::

### Metal reels

- Load the film from the **inside** by rotating the reel. 
- Hold the film start at the centre using either your **finger or a clip** (if present). 
- **Metal reels require more practice** but can be mastered with time. 

## Securing the film

Once fully loaded: 

- **120 film**: Peel the **tape** from the film to separate it from the backing paper. This prevents contamination. 
- **35mm film**: Use scissors to **cut the film from the canister**. Be careful when handling scissors inside a changing bag. 

Finally, **place the loaded reel inside the tank and attach the lid**. The tank is now light-tight and can be removed from the changing bag, ready for chemical processing.
