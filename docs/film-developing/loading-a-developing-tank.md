# Loading a developing tank

As daylight-loading developing tanks often include specific instructions for their design, this section will focus on using dark-loading developing tanks, which will be referred to simply as 'developing tanks'. These must be used alongside either a changing bag or a completely dark room. 

## Retrieving the film

When developing 35mm film, first retrieve the leader from the canister and cut at a 90Â° angle. This helps both edges of the film enter the developing tank reel smoothly. With Patterson reels, it is possible to begin loading outside the changing bag depending on how much film was exposed when loading the camera. Usually, enough film can be loaded on the reel to reach the ball bearings that prevent the film from slipping backwards.   

For 120 film, separating the backing paper and film must be done entirely in the changing bag. To simplify the process, fold over the end of the backing paper when finishing the roll, rather than sealing it flush.

## Loading the tank

When using a plastic reel, the film is loaded from the outside by moving the two sides of the reel back and forth, advancing the film gently to avoid buckling or bending. If the film comes free from the track, rewinding to start again is often the best solution.

When using a metal reel, the film is loaded from the inside by rotating the reel while holding the start of the film at the centre using either your finger or a clip if your reel has one. Loading metal reels can be trickier than loading plastic reels, but both can be mastered with a few attempts. 

After loading the full length of the film it must be freed from it from its packaging. For medium format film, peel the tape from the film to separate it from the backing paper, preventing tape from entering the developing tank to prevent contamination. For 35mm film, cut the film from the canister with scissors, being careful when using them inside a changing bag.

Once the film is fully loaded onto the reel, place it inside the developing tank and attach the lid. The tank can now be removed from the changing bag and set aside while you prepare the processing chemicals.
