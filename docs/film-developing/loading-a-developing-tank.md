# Loading a developing tank

Daylight-loading tanks often have specific instructions, so this guide focuses on **dark-loading developing tanks**, referred to simply as *developing tanks*. 
These require either a [changing bag](/film-developing/equipment-and-materials#changing-bag) or a **completely dark room** to safely load the film. 

## Retrieving the film

### 35mm film

1. Use a [leader retriever](/appendix/how-to-use-a-leader-retriever) to retrieve the leader from inside the canister. 
2. Cut it at a **90Â° angle** to help the film enter the reel smoothly. 
3. With **Paterson reels**, you may be able to start loading outside the changing bag. If the film has enough exposed length, you can feed it onto the reel until it reaches the **ball bearings**, which prevent slipping. 

### 120 film

- The [backing paper](/glossary#backing-paper) and film must be separated **entirely in the changing bag**. 
- To make this easier, fold over the backing paper's end when finishing the roll instead of sealing it flush.

## Loading the tank

### Plastic reels

- Load the film from the **outside** by moving the reel sides back and forth. 
- **Avoid buckling or bending** the film. 
- If the film comes free from the track, **rewind and start again**. 

### Metal reels

- Load the film from the **inside** by rotating the reel. 
- Hold the film start at the centre using either your **finger or a clip** (if present). 
- **Metal reels require more practice** but can be mastered with time. 

## Securing the film

Once fully loaded: 

- **120 film**: Peel the **tape** from the film to separate it from the backing paper. This prevents contamination. 
- **35mm film**: Use scissors to **cut the film from the canister**. Be careful when handling scissors inside a changing bag. 

Finally, **place the loaded reel inside the tank and attach the lid**. The tank is now light-tight and can be removed from the changing bag, ready for chemical processing.
