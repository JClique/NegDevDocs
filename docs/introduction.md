# Introduction

Welcome to the **Negative Development Docs**—your guide to the world of analogue photography, film developing, and darkroom printing. 
Whether you’re a beginner looking for a structured way to learn, an experienced photographer in need of reference materials, or an educator building a curriculum, this documentation is designed to be a comprehensive and practical guide.

## Why this resource exists

This documentation is made possible by the support for our [physical darkroom](https://www.negativedevelopment.co.uk/), a community space hosted in Pollard Yard, Manchester.
The workshop sales and direct support from our community fund not only the physical space but also the hosting and ongoing development of this resource. 
Our goal is to ensure that the knowledge and techniques of analogue photography remain accessible to everyone, regardless of location.

## How to use these docs

The documentation is structured to provide clear, practical guidance for independent learning. 
While our physical darkroom offers hands-on workshops, these docs are designed to stand on their own—giving you everything you need to start experimenting with film at home or in your own workspace.
