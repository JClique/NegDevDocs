This diagram shows the diaphragm of a lens, opening to several apertures. 
On the left, f1.4 which is the largest opening allowing the most amount of light and producing the shallowest depth of field. 
Next is f2.8, which has a slightly smaller opening, followed by f5.6, which is even smaller.
Lastly it shows f16 which has the smallest opening of the four, and produces the largest depth of field. 

### Film format diagram

This diagram compares the frame sizes of 35mm and 120 medium format film. 
On the left, 35mm film has a fixed frame size of 36×24mm with perforations along the edges. 
On the right, 120 film is wider at 60mm and supports multiple frame sizes, including 6×4.5cm, 6×6cm, 6×7cm, and 6×9cm. 
Unlike 35mm, 120 film does not have perforations and offers larger negatives, which capture more detail and produce higher-quality images with less visible grain.
