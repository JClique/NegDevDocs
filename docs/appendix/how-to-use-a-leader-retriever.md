# How to use a leader retriever

A leader retriever is a simple tool designed to extract the film leader from a fully wound 35mm film canister. 
This is useful when a film is accidentally rewound too far or when preparing for film processing.

## What you need

- A 35mm film canister with the leader fully wound inside  
- A leader retriever  

## Steps to retrieve the film leader

The leader retriever consists of three thin plastic blades, two of which are movable. 
Before starting ensure the blades are fully retracted, and

1. **Insert the blades**  
Insert all three plastic blades gently into the thin opening along the side of the film canister. 

2. **Extend the first blade**  
Moving the first tab closest to the film canister, usually labelled 'A', extend the first plastic blade fully into the film canister.

3. **Engage the film**  
Rotate the film spool slowly in the direction of winding (clockwise when viewed from the top). As the film moves, you may hear or feel a slight "click" as it slips between the two blades.

4. **Extend the second blade**  
Moving the second tab furthest away from the film canister, usually labelled 'B', extend the second plastic blade fully into the film cannister.

5. **Pull out the leader**  
While holding the retriever firmly in place, pull both blades out together. The film leader should come out with them.

## Troubleshooting

- If the leader does not emerge, rewind the spool slightly and try again.  
- Ensure the blades are inserted correctlyâ€”too much force may damage the film edges.  
- Some film brands may have tighter or looser spools, requiring slight adjustments in technique.  

## Alternative method

If a leader retriever is unavailable, a piece of double-sided tape attached to the end of a thin strip of film can sometimes be used to extract the leader. 
Insert the taped strip, rotate the spool, and gently pull it out.  

Using a leader retriever properly can save time and prevent accidental film exposure. Practise with a scrap roll to get comfortable with the process.
