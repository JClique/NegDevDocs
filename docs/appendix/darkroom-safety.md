# Darkroom safety

Working in a darkroom involves unique safety considerations. 
One of the most important is *light safety*, which ensures photographic paper is not exposed prematurely. 
Just as crucial is *personal safety*, as working in confined, low-light spaces with chemical processes presents specific risks. 
This guide will help you set up and maintain a darkroom that is both functional and safe.

## Making the space safe

Before focusing on light or chemicals, it's worth thinking about how to make the space itself safe and easy to work in. 
This includes everything from keeping the floor dry and uncluttered to ensuring there is enough ventilation. 
A well-organised darkroom not only prevents accidents but also makes the process of developing and printing film more enjoyable.

Tips for creating a safe workspace:

- Keep walkways clear of cables and equipment.
- Use non-slip mats if the floor gets wet.
- Designate specific areas for enlarging, developing, washing, and drying.
- Make sure emergency exits or paths are clearly marked and accessible.
- Install proper ventilation to reduce the buildup of chemical fumes.

## Light safety

Darkrooms aren’t completely dark—they're controlled environments where light is managed carefully to avoid fogging photographic paper. 
Most black & white printing papers are sensitive to parts of the visible light spectrum, but not all. 
Safelights are used to provide just enough illumination for working, without damaging the prints.

### Safelight basics

- **Red safelights** are generally safe for most black & white variable contrast and graded papers.
- **Amber or yellow-green safelights** may be suitable for certain papers, especially if listed as orthochromatic.

Always check the manufacturer’s guidelines for the paper you're using to determine appropriate safelight use.

### Tips for lightproofing a space

- Check for light leaks around doors and windows. Use blackout fabric or foam weather stripping to seal gaps.
- Use a digital camera or phone in a darkroom test: leave it recording in total darkness and review for any light leaks.
- Avoid using reflective materials (like mirrors or glossy surfaces) near the enlarging area.
- Position safelights so they don’t shine directly on your working surface.

## Personal safety

Darkroom work involves handling chemicals and navigating low-light spaces, both of which require care and attention. 
While the materials used are generally safe when handled properly, it's important to follow good practices to reduce risk and create a comfortable working environment.

### Common safety tips

- Always wear gloves when handling chemistry, especially when mixing concentrated solutions.
- Use tongs for print processing trays to avoid prolonged skin contact.
- Store all chemicals in clearly labelled, lightproof containers away from food and drink.
- Ensure good airflow to reduce inhalation of fumes—open windows or install an extractor fan if needed.
- Clean up spills immediately, especially near electrical equipment.
- Keep a basic first aid kit in the darkroom and make sure everyone knows where it is.

Creating a safe darkroom doesn't need to be complicated. 
With a few simple steps and a bit of awareness, you can build a space that protects your materials, your body, and your peace of mind—making your time in the darkroom more productive and enjoyable.
