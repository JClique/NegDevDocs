# Black & white film developing manual test

If no official time is provided by the manufacturer, and our [black & white film developing time calculator](/appendix/black-and-white-film-developing-time-calculator) doesn't have the necessary information, you can perform a **development test**.

### How to test
- Cut a test strip of film and immerse it in the developer.
- Time how long it takes to turn completely dark.
- Divide this time by **three** to estimate the full development time.

**Example:**

If a film strip darkens in **17.02 seconds**, divide by **3** is **5.67** which means **5 minutes 40 seconds** is the estimated development time.
