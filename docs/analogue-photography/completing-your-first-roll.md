# Completing your first roll of film  

Reaching the end of your first roll of film is an exciting milestone. 
Whether you've carefully composed each shot or taken a more spontaneous approach, the next steps ensure your film is safely handled and ready for development. 
This guide will walk you through securing the roll, storing it correctly, and preparing for processing.  

## Securing the film  

Once you've exposed the final frame, you need to secure the film before development. 
The process depends on the camera and film format you’re using.  

### 35mm: rewinding and storage  

Most 35mm cameras require you to rewind the film before removing it. 
While many cameras count frames upwards from zero, some preload the film and count down instead, rewinding as they expose frames.  

::: warning ⚠ Waring
Although careful loading may allow an extra frame or two, forcing the film to advance too far risks breaking the film or the camera itself.

#### Manual cameras (SLRs and rangefinders)

1. Press the rewind release button (usually on the bottom of the camera).  
2. Flip out the rewind crank and turn it in the direction indicated by the arrow.  
3. Continue turning until you feel resistance, then keep rewinding until the tension releases—this means the film has disengaged from the take-up spool.  
4. Keep rewinding until the leader is fully pulled into the cassette.  
5. Open the camera and remove the film, keeping it in its canister until development.  

#### Automatic cameras (point-and-shoot and modern SLRs)

Many electronic cameras rewind the film automatically when the last frame is exposed. 
Some require you to press a rewind button, while others do this as soon as the film advances past the final frame.  

Always wait for the process to complete before opening the camera.  

### 120 film: securing and storage  

Unlike 35mm film, 120 film does not need to be rewound. 
Instead, as you advance through the roll, the film winds onto the take-up spool. 
After the final exposure, continue advancing until the backing paper is fully wrapped around the take-up spool. 

Once removed from the camera, ensure the backing paper remains tightly wound around the spool to avoid light exposure to the film. 
Secure the roll using the adhesive tab attached to the backing paper.


::: tip
Fold the end of your backing paper over before securing the adhesive tab.
This provides a neat, secure edge that is easier to peel back when developing without damaging the backing paper or the film.

## Storing your film  

Once your film has been rewound or secured, proper storage is important to maintain image quality before development. 

- **Short-term storage** – If you plan to develop your film within a few days, keeping it at room temperature in a dry place is usually fine.  
- **Long-term storage** – If you won’t be developing your film for weeks or months, store it in a cool, dry place away from direct sunlight.  
- **Protect the film** – Keep 120 film tightly sealed to prevent accidental exposure to light. For 35mm, store it in its plastic canister to prevent dust or dirt from entering the cartridge.  

## Developing and scanning  

Once you’re ready, the next step is development.  
You have several options:  

- **Lab developing** – Many professional labs develop various film stocks and processes. This is the most convenient option, as labs can handle both developing and scanning.  
- **Home developing** – With the right equipment and chemicals, you can develop film at home. Black-and-white film is the easiest to develop yourself, while colour film requires stricter temperature control.  
- **Community darkrooms** – Some cities have shared darkroom spaces (like [ours](https://negativedevelopment.co.uk/)!) where you can develop film and scan negatives using professional equipment.  

After development, you'll need to scan the negatives to create digital files.  
Scanning options include:  

- **Lab scanning** – Many film labs offer high-resolution scans during development.  
- **Flatbed scanning** – A good option for home scanning, with models like the Epson V600 supporting both 35mm and 120 film.  
- **dSLR scanning** – Using a digital camera, macro lens, and a light source, you can achieve high-quality scans with greater control over the final image.  

## Reviewing your results  

Once your negatives are developed and scanned, it’s time to evaluate the results.  
Well-exposed images should be clear, sharp, and properly dense.  
If issues arise, they may indicate problems during exposure, film handling, or development.  

- **No images, but film borders are visible** – The film was not loaded correctly, or the camera did not expose the film properly.  
- **No images and no film borders** – A problem occurred during development, such as incorrect chemical use or an exhausted developer.  
- **Incorrect exposure** – If your images are too light or too dark, revisit the [exposing a scene](/analogue-photography/exposing-a-scene) section.  
- **Incorrect focus** – If your images are blurry when they shouldn’t be, refer to the [focusing on subjects](/analogue-photography/focusing-on-subjects) section.  
- **Consistent issues** – If your negatives are consistently overexposed, underexposed, or out of focus despite correct technique, your camera may need servicing.  

## Conclusion  

Finishing your first roll of film is an exciting step in your journey with analogue photography.
Each roll you shoot helps you build confidence in handling, exposing, and processing film.  

By following the steps to rewind or secure your film, store it safely, and review your results, you’ll develop a better understanding of how your camera and film interact.
If your images turn out as expected, you’re on the right track—if not, analysing your negatives can help you refine your technique.  

Whether you choose to have your film processed at a lab, develop it yourself, or explore community darkrooms, the experience of shooting film doesn’t end when you press the shutter. 
With each roll, you’ll improve your skills and deepen your appreciation for the process. 
Keep shooting, experimenting, and learning—you’re just getting started.
