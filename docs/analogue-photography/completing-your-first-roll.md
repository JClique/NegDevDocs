# Completing your first roll of film  

Reaching the end of your first roll of film is an exciting milestone.
Whether you've carefully composed each shot or taken a more spontaneous approach, the next steps ensure your film is safely handled and ready for development. 
This guide will walk you through securing the roll, storing it correctly, and preparing for processing.  

## Securing the film  

Once you've exposed the final frame, your film needs to be secured before it can be developed. 
The process depends on camera and film format being used.  

### 35mm: rewinding and storage  

Most 35mm cameras require you to rewind the film before removing it.  
While many count frames upwards from zero, some preload the film and count down instead, rewinding as they expose frames.  
If your camera counts up, careful loading may allow an extra frame or two, but forcing the film to advance too far risks exposing the leader.

#### **Manual cameras (SLRs and rangefinders)**  

1. Press the rewind release button (usually on the bottom of the camera).  
2. Flip out the rewind crank and begin turning it in the direction indicated by the arrow.  
3. Turn the crank until you feel resistance, then continue rewinding until the tension releases—this means the film has disengaged from the take-up spool.  
4. Continue rewinding until the leader is pulled fully into the cassette.  
5. Open the camera and remove the film, keeping it in its canister until development.  

#### **Automatic point-and-shoot cameras**  

Many compact cameras rewind the film automatically when the last frame is exposed.  
Some require you to press a rewind button, while others do this as soon as the film advances past the final frame.  
Always wait for the process to complete before opening the camera.  

### 120 film: securing and storage  

Unlike 35mm film, 120 film does not need to be rewound. 
Instead, as you advance through the roll, the film winds onto the take-up spool.  
After the final exposure, continue advancing until the backing paper is fully wrapped around the film.  
Secure the roll using the adhesive tab attached to the backing paper.  

## Storing your film  

Once your film has been rewound or secured, proper storage is important to maintain image quality before development.  

- **Short-term storage** – If you plan to develop your film within a few days, keeping it at room temperature in a dry place is usually fine.  
- **Long-term storage** – If you won’t be developing your film for weeks or months, store it in a cool, dry place away from direct sunlight.  
- **Protect the film** – Keep 120 film tightly sealed to prevent accidental exposure to light. For 35mm, keep it in the supplied pot to avoid dust or dirt from entering the canister.  

## Developing and scanning  

Once your ready, the next step is development. You have several options:  

- **Film labs** – Many professional labs offer film developing services for different film stocks and processes. This is the most convenient option, as labs can handle both developing and scanning.  
- **Home developing** – With the right equipment and chemicals, you can develop film at home. Black-and-white film is the easiest to develop yourself, while colour film requires stricter temperature control.  
- **Community darkrooms** – Some cities have shared darkroom spaces (like [ours](https://negativedevelopment.co.uk/)!) where you can develop film and scan negatives using professional equipment.  

After development, you'll need to scan the negatives to create digital files. Scanning options include:  

- **Lab scanning** – Many film labs offer high-resolution scans during development.  
- **Flatbed scanners** – A good option for home scanning, with models like the Epson V600 supporting both 35mm and 120 film.  
- **dSLR scanning** – Using a digital camera, macro lens, and a light source, you can achieve high-quality scans with greater control over the final image.  

## Reviewing your results  

Once your negatives are developed and scanned, it’s time to evaluate the results. Well-exposed images should be clear, sharp, and properly dense. If issues arise, they may indicate problems during exposure, film handling, or development.  

- **No images, but film borders are visible** – The film was not loaded correctly, or the camera did not expose the film properly.  
- **No images and no film borders** – A problem occurred during development, such as incorrect chemical use or an exhausted developer.  
- **Incorrect exposure** – If your images are too light or too dark, revisit the [Exposing a scene](/analogue-photography/exposing-a-scene) section.  
- **Incorrect focus** – If your images are blurry when they shouldn’t be, refer to the [Focusing on subjects](/analogue-photography/focusing-on-subjects) section.  
- **Consistent issues** – If your negatives are consistently overexposed, underexposed, or out of focus despite correct technique, your camera may need servicing.  

## Conclusion  

Completing your first roll of film is just the beginning of the process. 
By carefully rewinding or securing your film, storing it properly, and reviewing your results, you’ll gain a better understanding of your camera and film workflow. 
Whether you choose to work with a lab or explore home processing, each roll will bring you closer to mastering film photography.
