# Choosing and loading film

Choosing the right film and learning how to load it properly is essential for getting started with analogue photography. This guide will introduce different film formats, the types of film available, and how to choose the best option for your needs. Finally, we will cover how to load film into different types of cameras.

## Film formats  

Film comes in several different formats, each offering its own unique qualities. The most common formats still being manufactured today include:  

- **35mm** – The most popular film format, used in everything from compact point-and-shoots to professional SLRs. Each roll typically provides 24 or 36 exposures and is easy to find and develop.  
- **120 (Medium Format)** – A larger film format used in medium format cameras. It offers higher image quality when compared to 35mm and allows for various aspect ratios, such as 6x6, 6x7, or 6x9. The number of exposures depends on the camera and frame size.  
- **Large Format (4x5, 8x10, etc.)** – Used by photographers who want the ultimate in image quality. Large format film is sheet-based, requiring one piece of film per exposure. Cameras for this format are often used on tripods and offer complete control over focus and perspective.  
- **Instant Film** – Available in various formats such as Polaroid and Instax, instant film develops shortly after exposure, making it perfect for fun, spontaneous photography.  

Some film formats, such as **APS**, **126**, and **Disc Film**, are no longer in production, but expired rolls can sometimes be found from specialty retailers.  

## Film types

There are three main types of photographic film, each with unique characteristics:

- **Black & White** – A versatile option with a classic aesthetic. It is often preferred by beginners who want to develop their own film, as the process is simpler than colour film.
- **Colour Negative (C41 Process)** – The most common colour film, used for general photography. It is widely available, and labs typically offer affordable and fast development.
- **Slide Film (E6 Process)** – Also known as positive or reversal film, slide film produces a direct positive image. It offers vibrant colours and fine grain but requires precise exposure and a more specialised development process.

::: tip **Note:**
Some film stocks, such as Kodak Vision3, are designed for motion picture cameras and require **ECN-2 processing**. While these films can sometimes be processed in C41 chemistry, they may produce unexpected results. If you’re considering ECN-2 film, make sure your lab can handle it!

## Choosing a film  

### Choosing a film type  

Your choice of film type depends on your shooting style and how you plan to develop your images.  

- If you want to **develop at home**, black & white film is the best choice. It requires minimal equipment and has a straightforward development process.  
- If you plan to **use a lab**, colour negative (C41) film is your best bet. It’s widely available, affordable to process, and generally more forgiving in exposure than slide film.  

### Understanding film ISO  

ISO (or film speed / box speed) determines how sensitive the film is to light. A lower ISO means finer grain and better detail in bright conditions, while a higher ISO allows for better performance in low light. When shopping for film, you’ll find the ISO rating on the box, usually displayed as **100, 200, 400, 800**, or higher.  

Here’s a quick guide to choosing the right ISO:  

- **ISO 200** – Perfect for bright daylight and outdoor photography.  
- **ISO 400** – A versatile choice, great for a mix of indoor and outdoor shooting.  
- **ISO 800+** – Best for low-light, evening, or indoor photography without a flash.


## Loading a film camera

Every camera model has its own specific loading procedure, so it is always best to consult the camera’s manual. However, the following general guidelines apply to most common film cameras.

::: warning ⚠ **Warning:**
When loading a film camera, avoid touching the [shutter curtain](/glossary#shutter-curtain). The shutter is extremely delicate, and damage can be difficult (and expensive) to repair. Always handle the film carefully and keep fingers away from the shutter mechanism.

### Point and shoot cameras  

Most point-and-shoot cameras make loading easy:  

1. Open the back of the camera.  
2. Insert the film canister into the film chamber.  
3. Pull the film leader across to the [take-up spool](/glossary#take-up-spool).  
4. Align the film with any guide markers.  
5. Close the back of the camera.  

Some point-and-shoot cameras **automatically advance the film**, while others require manual winding using a small thumb wheel or lever.  

### 35mm SLR cameras  

SLR cameras require a more hands-on approach when loading film:  

1. Open the camera back.  
2. Insert the film leader into the [take-up spool](/glossary#take-up-spool) **before** pulling the film across.  
3. Gently pull the film across and drop the film canister into the chamber.  
4. Ensure the film perforations align with the camera’s sprockets.  
5. Use the advance lever to wind the film slightly, checking that it moves smoothly.  
6. Close the camera back and fire a few blank shots to ensure proper advancement.  

### Medium format cameras  

Medium format cameras vary greatly in design, but all **120 film is mounted on backing paper**, which helps guide the film through the camera.  

1. Open the film back or camera body.  
2. Insert a new roll of **120 film** into the supply side.  
3. Pull the **backing paper** across the camera body or film back to the [take-up spool](/glossary#take-up-spool).  
4. Thread the backing paper onto the take-up spool and wind until the start marker aligns with the camera’s indicator.  
5. Close the back and advance the film to the first frame.  

## Conclusion

Choosing the right film depends on your shooting environment, processing preferences, and desired aesthetic. Once you've selected your film, proper loading ensures that you get the best results from your camera. Take your time, follow the steps carefully, and enjoy the process of shooting film!
