# Choosing and loading film

To start with analogue photography, you need to choose the right film and learn how to load it.
This guide will help you pick the best film for your needs, understand available options, and learn how to load film into different types of cameras.

## Choosing a film  

The type of film you choose has a significant impact on the look and feel of your photographs. 
Each type varies in levels of contrast, colour tones, and grain structure, and some are better suited to specific lighting conditions.  

Before selecting a film, consider:  
- Where and how you'll be shooting  
- Whether you want to develop it yourself  
- The final image style you're aiming for  

This section will guide you in choosing between black & white or colour film, understanding film ISO, and selecting the best option for your needs.

### Black & white or colour  

One of the first decisions is whether to shoot in black & white or colour.
Both offer unique creative possibilities, and your choice will depend on your desired aesthetic and how you plan to develop the film.  

| **Film type**     | **Best for**                                      | **Development**                     |
|-------------------|---------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| **Black & white** | Classic, high contrast, easier to develop at home | Simple home processing              |
| **Colour (C41)**  | Vibrant, natural tones                            | Requires a lab or special chemicals |

- If you want to **develop your own film**, black & white film is the best choice. It requires minimal equipment and has a straightforward development process.  
- If you plan to **use a lab**, colour negative (C41) film is your best bet. It’s widely available, affordable to process, and generally more forgiving in exposure than slide film.  

### Understanding film ISO  

ISO (or film speed / box speed) determines how sensitive the film is to light.
Lower ISO provides finer grain and better detail in bright conditions, while higher ISO performs better in low light.

When shopping for film, you’ll find the ISO rating on the box, usually displayed as **100, 200, 400, 800**, or higher.

Here’s a quick guide to choosing the right ISO:  

- **ISO 100/200** – Perfect for bright daylight and outdoor photography.  
- **ISO 400** – A versatile choice, great for a mix of indoor and outdoor shooting.  
- **ISO 800+** – Best for low-light, evening, or indoor photography without a flash.

## Loading a film camera

Every camera has its own specific loading procedure, so always check the manual. However, these general steps apply to most cameras.  

::: warning ⚠ **Handle with care!**  
Avoid touching the [shutter curtain](/glossary#shutter-curtain)—it’s delicate and costly to repair. Always handle the film carefully and keep fingers away from the shutter.

### Loading point-and-shoot cameras  

Most point-and-shoot cameras make loading simple:  

1. Open the back of the camera.  
2. Insert the film canister into the film chamber.  
3. Pull the film leader across to the [take-up spool](/glossary#take-up-spool).  
4. Align the film with any guide markers.  
5. Close the back of the camera.  

Some point-and-shoot cameras **automatically advance the film**, while others require manual winding using a small thumb wheel or lever.  

### Loading 35mm SLR cameras  

SLR cameras require a more hands-on approach when loading film:  

1. Open the camera back.  
2. Insert the film leader into the take-up spool **before** pulling the film across.  
3. Gently pull the film across and drop the film canister into the chamber, while holding the film secured in the take-up spool.
4. Ensure the [film perforations](/glossary#film-perforations) align with the camera’s sprockets.  
5. Use the advance lever to wind the film slightly, checking that it moves smoothly.  
6. Close the camera back and fire a few blank shots to ensure proper advancement.  

### Loading medium format cameras  

Medium format cameras vary greatly in design, but all **120 film is mounted on backing paper**, which helps guide the film through the camera.  

1. Open the film back or camera body.  
2. Insert a new roll of **120 film** into the supply side. Often the supply side will contain the empty spool from the previous roll. 
3. Pull the [backing paper](/glossary#backing-paper) across the camera body or film back to the take-up spool.  
4. Thread the backing paper onto the take-up spool and wind until the start marker aligns with the camera’s indicator.  
5. Close the back and advance the film to the first frame.

## Conclusion

Choosing the right film depends on your shooting environment, processing preferences, and desired aesthetic. 
Once you've selected your film, proper loading ensures that you get the best results from your camera. 
Take your time, follow the steps carefully, and most importantly—enjoy the process of shooting film!
