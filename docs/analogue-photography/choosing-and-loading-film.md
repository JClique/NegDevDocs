# Choosing and loading film

Choosing the right film and learning how to load it properly is essential for getting started with analogue photography. 
This guide will explain how to choose the best film option for your needs, and the equipment available to you. 
Finally, we will cover how to load film into different types of cameras.

## Choosing a film  

The type of film you choose has a significant impact on the look and feel of your photographs. 
Different films produce different levels of contrast, color tones, and grain structure, and some are better suited to specific lighting conditions.  

Before selecting a film, consider how and where you’ll be shooting, whether you want to develop it yourself, and what kind of final image you’re hoping to achieve. 
This section will help you decide between black & white or color film, understand film ISO, and choose the best option for your needs.

### Black & white or colour  

One of the first decisions when choosing film is whether to shoot in black & white or color. 
Both offer unique creative possibilities, and your choice will depend on your desired aesthetic and how you plan to develop the film.  

Black & white film emphasizes light, shadow, and texture, giving images a timeless, classic feel. 
It’s also more forgiving in exposure and easier to develop at home. 
Color film captures the full spectrum of tones, making it ideal for capturing vibrant scenes, subtle color shifts, and natural-looking skin tones.  

The choice between the two largely comes down to personal preference, accessibility, and workflow.  

- If you want to **develop your own film**, black & white film is the best choice. It requires minimal equipment and has a straightforward development process.  
- If you plan to **use a lab**, colour negative (C41) film is your best bet. It’s widely available, affordable to process, and generally more forgiving in exposure than slide film.  

### Understanding film ISO  

ISO (or film speed / box speed) determines how sensitive the film is to light. A lower ISO means finer grain and better detail in bright conditions, while a higher ISO allows for better performance in low light. When shopping for film, you’ll find the ISO rating on the box, usually displayed as **100, 200, 400, 800**, or higher.  

Here’s a quick guide to choosing the right ISO:  

- **ISO 200** – Perfect for bright daylight and outdoor photography.  
- **ISO 400** – A versatile choice, great for a mix of indoor and outdoor shooting.  
- **ISO 800+** – Best for low-light, evening, or indoor photography without a flash.

## Loading a film camera

Every camera model has its own specific loading procedure, so it is always best to consult the camera’s manual. However, the following general guidelines apply to most common film cameras.

::: warning ⚠ **Warning:**
When loading a film camera, avoid touching the [shutter curtain](/glossary#shutter-curtain). The shutter is extremely delicate, and damage can be difficult (and expensive) to repair. Always handle the film carefully and keep fingers away from the shutter mechanism.

### Point and shoot cameras  

Most point-and-shoot cameras make loading easy:  

1. Open the back of the camera.  
2. Insert the film canister into the film chamber.  
3. Pull the film leader across to the [take-up spool](/glossary#take-up-spool).  
4. Align the film with any guide markers.  
5. Close the back of the camera.  

Some point-and-shoot cameras **automatically advance the film**, while others require manual winding using a small thumb wheel or lever.  

### 35mm SLR cameras  

SLR cameras require a more hands-on approach when loading film:  

1. Open the camera back.  
2. Insert the film leader into the [take-up spool](/glossary#take-up-spool) **before** pulling the film across.  
3. Gently pull the film across and drop the film canister into the chamber.  
4. Ensure the film perforations align with the camera’s sprockets.  
5. Use the advance lever to wind the film slightly, checking that it moves smoothly.  
6. Close the camera back and fire a few blank shots to ensure proper advancement.  

### Medium format cameras  

Medium format cameras vary greatly in design, but all **120 film is mounted on backing paper**, which helps guide the film through the camera.  

1. Open the film back or camera body.  
2. Insert a new roll of **120 film** into the supply side.  
3. Pull the **backing paper** across the camera body or film back to the [take-up spool](/glossary#take-up-spool).  
4. Thread the backing paper onto the take-up spool and wind until the start marker aligns with the camera’s indicator.  
5. Close the back and advance the film to the first frame.  

## Conclusion

Choosing the right film depends on your shooting environment, processing preferences, and desired aesthetic. Once you've selected your film, proper loading ensures that you get the best results from your camera. Take your time, follow the steps carefully, and enjoy the process of shooting film!
