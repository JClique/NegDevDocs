# Getting started with analogue photography

Photography is the art of capturing light. 
While digital photography has become the standard in recent decades, analogue photography remains a beloved medium for many. 

This guide covers the basics of analogue photography, including what film is and why many photographers still use it today. 
You’ll also learn about different types of film cameras, how they work, and what to check before using a vintage camera for the first time.

## What is film?  

Photographic film is the material that captures an image when exposed to light. 
It has a plastic base coated with layers of emulsion containing [silver halide crystals](/glossary#silver-halide-crystals). 
When exposed to light through a camera lens, these crystals undergo a chemical reaction that creates a latent image, which is later developed in a darkroom or lab.

### Film formats  

Film comes in several different formats, each offering its own unique qualities. The most common formats still being manufactured today include:  

- **35mm** – The most popular film format, used in everything from compact point-and-shoots to professional SLRs. Each roll typically provides 24 or 36 exposures and is easy to find and develop.  
- **120 (Medium Format)** – A larger film format used in medium format cameras. It offers higher image quality when compared to 35mm and allows for various aspect ratios, such as 6x6, 6x7, or 6x9. The number of exposures depends on the camera and frame size.  
- **Large Format (4x5, 8x10, etc.)** – Used by photographers who want the ultimate in image quality. Large format film is sheet-based, requiring one piece of film per exposure. Cameras for this format are often used on tripods and offer complete control over focus and perspective.  
- **Instant Film** – Available in various formats such as Polaroid and Instax, instant film develops shortly after exposure, making it perfect for fun, spontaneous photography.  

Some film formats, such as **APS**, **126**, and **Disc Film**, are no longer in production, but expired rolls can sometimes be found from specialty retailers.  

### Film types

There are three main types of photographic film, each with unique characteristics:

- **Black & white** – A versatile option with a classic aesthetic. It is often preferred by beginners who want to develop their own film, as the process is simpler than colour film.
- **Colour negative (C41 process)** – The most common colour film, used for general photography. It is widely available, and labs typically offer affordable and fast development.
- **Slide film (E6 process)** – Also known as positive or reversal film, slide film produces a direct positive image. It offers vibrant colours and fine grain but requires precise exposure and a more specialised development process.

::: tip **Note:**
Some film stocks, such as Kodak Vision3, are designed for motion picture cameras and require **ECN-2 processing**. While these films can sometimes be processed in C41 chemistry, they may produce unexpected results. If you’re considering ECN-2 film, make sure your lab can handle it!

### Negatives and positives

Once a roll of film has been developed, it produces either **negatives** or **positives**, depending on the type of film used.  

- **Negative film** (black and white or color) produces an inverted image where light areas appear dark, and dark areas appear light. Colors are also reversed in color negative film. These negatives must be either scanned digitally or printed in a darkroom to create a final positive image.  
- **Slide film** produces a **positive image**, meaning the developed film directly represents the colors and tones of the original scene. These can be viewed on a lightbox, projected, or scanned for digital use.  

For negatives, the most common method of converting them into viewable images is by **printing in a darkroom** or **scanning and digitally inverting** them. 
In the darkroom, negatives are placed in an enlarger, projected onto light-sensitive photographic paper, and developed using chemicals to produce a final print.  

With digital scanning, negatives are scanned using a specialized film scanner or DSLR setup, then digitally inverted and color-corrected. 
This allows film photographers to share and print their images without requiring a full darkroom setup.

## Why shoot film?

Digital photography offers instant feedback, unlimited storage, and ease of use. 
Despite this, film remains popular for its unique qualities and creative possibilities.

### A unique look
Film has a distinct aesthetic that digital photography often struggles to replicate. 
The combination of film grain, dynamic range, and chemical processing results in images that feel organic and full of character.

### A slower, more thoughtful process  

With only 24 or 36 shots per roll, film encourages a more deliberate approach. 
Photographers take time to compose each image and carefully consider their settings, leading to more thoughtful and intentional photography. 
Unlike digital photography, where it's easy to take hundreds of images without much thought, film encourages precision and patience.  

### A physical medium  

Film photography creates tangible negatives and prints, offering a different connection to images compared to digital files. 
Negatives can be archived, scanned, or printed decades later without concerns about hard drive failures or file corruption. 
Physical prints from a darkroom or lab also have a unique, handcrafted feel, making the photographic process more immersive and rewarding.  

### Experimental possibilities  

Shooting film opens the door to creative techniques that are difficult or impossible to achieve digitally:  

- **Double exposures:** Exposing the same piece of film twice to blend images together.
- **Alternative processing:** Cross-processing slide film in C-41 chemicals for surreal colors, or developing black and white film in coffee (caffenol) for an experimental touch.
- **Film souping:** Intentionally damaging the film chemically before or during development to create unpredictable and interesting results.

These techniques make film photography a playground for experimentation.

## How to shoot film  

To shoot film, you need a working camera. Film cameras come in various types, each offering different features and levels of control.  

### Common types of film cameras  

| Camera type                                       | Best for                                | Example models               |
|---------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|------------------------------|
| [Point-and-shoot](/glossary#point-and-shoot-camera) | Casual users, ease of use               | Canon Sure Shot, Olympus mju |
| [SLR](/glossary#slr-camera)                       | Manual control, interchangeable lenses  | Nikon FM, Canon AE-1         |
| [Rangefinder](/glossary#rangefinder-camera)       | Compact size, precise focusing          | Leica M series, Canonet      |
| [Medium format](/glossary#medium-format-camera)   | High image quality, professional use    | Hasselblad 500, Mamiya RB67  |
| [Instant cameras](/glossary#instant-camera)       | Quick results, fun photography          | Polaroid SX-70, Instax Mini  |
| [Box cameras](/glossary#box-camera)               | Simplicity, vintage appeal              | Kodak Brownie, Agfa Box      |

### Checking if a vintage camera is functional  

Before loading film into a vintage camera, check for the following:  

- **Shutter operation** – Fire the shutter and ensure it opens and closes properly.  
- **Film advance mechanism** – Open the back and test if the take-up spool moves when the shutter is fired.  
- **Lens condition** – Look for fog, fungus, or scratches that may affect image quality.  
- **Battery compartment** – If the camera has electronics, check for corrosion and ensure it powers on.  

Many cameras, especially mechanical ones, can function without batteries, but some require power for light meters or shutters.  

## Conclusion  

Analogue cameras remain a fascinating and rewarding way to explore photography. 
Whether you find a simple point-and-shoot or a classic SLR, many vintage cameras can still be used today with a little care and maintenance. 
Checking basic functionality before loading film ensures a smooth shooting experience, keeping the magic of film photography alive.
