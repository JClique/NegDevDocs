# Getting started with analogue photography

Photography is the art of capturing light. 
While digital photography has become the standard in recent decades, analogue photography remains a beloved medium for many. 

This guide provides a foundational understanding of analogue photography, from what film is and why many still choose it when capturing images, to a detailed section covering different types of film cameras, how they work, and what to check when using a vintage camera for the first time.  

## What is Film?  

Photographic film is a light-sensitive material that captures images when exposed to light. 
It consists of a plastic base coated with layers of emulsion containing [silver halide crystals](/glossary#silver-halide-crystals). 
When exposed to light through a camera lens, these crystals undergo a chemical reaction that creates a latent image, which is later developed in a darkroom or lab.

## Why shoot film?  

With the convenience of digital photography, why do so many people still shoot film? Here are some reasons:  

- **A unique look** – Film produces distinct colors, tones, and grain that many find aesthetically pleasing.  
- **A slower, more thoughtful process** – With a limited number of exposures per roll, shooting film encourages a more deliberate approach to photography.  
- **A physical medium** – Unlike digital files, film negatives and prints are tangible objects that can be stored, displayed, and preserved for decades.  
- **Experimental possibilities** – From multiple exposures to alternative developing techniques, film offers a wide range of creative options.

## How to shoot film  

To shoot film, you need a working camera. 
Film cameras come in many types, from fully automatic models to entirely manual mechanical designs. 
Each has its own way of handling film, focusing, and metering light.  

The following section covers the most common types of film cameras, how they work, and essential checks to ensure they are functioning properly before use.  

### Point-and-shoot cameras

Compact and fully automated, these cameras are designed for ease of use.
These cameras use 35mm film and have automatic focus and exposure settings. 
They often include a built-in flash.

**Common Manufacturers:**  
- Canon (Sure Shot series)  
- Olympus (mju/Stylus series)  
- Nikon (L35AF series)  
- Minolta (Hi-Matic series)  
- Pentax (Espio series) 

::: details **How to check your camera is functional** 
  - Insert batteries and check if the camera powers on.
  - Open the film compartment to ensure the [take-up spool](/glossary#take-up-spool) moves when the shutter is fired.
  - Test the flash (if included) by enabling it and taking a shot.

**Vital features to check:**
  - Working shutter and film advance mechanism.
  - Functional lens (free from fog or fungus).
  - Battery compartment is free of corrosion and fully intact.

**Battery type:** 
Typically uses AA, AAA, CR123A, or CR2 batteries.

### SLR (single-lens reflex) cameras

More advanced than point-and-shoots, SLRs allow interchangeable lenses and manual settings.
These cameras use a mirror and prism system to show an accurate view through the lens. 
They often have full manual controls.

**Common Manufacturers:**  
- Nikon (FM, FE, F series)  
- Canon (AE-1, A-1)  
- Pentax (K1000, Spotmatic)  
- Minolta (X-700, SRT series)  
- Olympus (OM series)  

::: details **How to check your camera is functional** 
  - Fire the shutter at different speeds and check if it visibly changes.
  - Look through the viewfinder and check for obstructions.
  - Check if the film advance lever works smoothly.

**Vital features to check:**
  - Light meter (if present) should respond to light changes.
  - Shutter speeds should change as expected.
  - Lens should be clear and focus properly.

**Battery type:** 
Typically uses button cell batteries like LR44 or PX625, depending on the model.
:::

### Rangefinder cameras

Compact and precise, rangefinders use a focusing mechanism that overlays two images.
Unlike SLRs, rangefinders do not have a mirror; instead, they use a coupled viewfinder system for focusing.

**Common Manufacturers:**  
- Leica (M series)  
- Canon (Canonet series)  
- Minolta (CLE, Hi-Matic)  
- Yashica (Electro 35 series)  
- Olympus (35 SP, 35 RC)

::: details **How to check your camera is functional** 
  - Check if the rangefinder patch aligns properly when adjusting focus.
  - Ensure the shutter fires and the speeds change correctly.
  - Inspect the film advance lever.

**Vital features to check:**
  - Rangefinder patch should be visible and align properly.
  - Shutter should operate at different speeds.
  - Lens should be clear and adjust smoothly.

**Battery type:** 
Some models require button cell batteries (LR44, PX625) for light meters, while fully mechanical models need no battery.

### Medium format cameras

Medium format cameras produce larger negatives for higher image quality.
Uses 120 or 220 film with either a twin-lens reflex (TLR) or single-lens reflex (SLR) system.

**Common Manufacturers:**  
- Mamiya (RB67, C330)  
- Hasselblad (500 series)  
- Bronica (ETR, GS series)  
- Rollei (TLR series)  
- Pentax (67, 645)

::: details **How to check your camera is functional** 
  - Fire the shutter at different speeds and check for function.
  - Open the back to ensure film transport works.
  - Check if the focusing screen is bright and clear.

**Vital features to check:**
  - Shutter operation and film advance should be smooth.
  - Lens should be clean and free of haze.
  - Waist-level or prism finder should be clear.

**Battery type:** 
Many are fully mechanical, but some metered models use button cell batteries (PX625, LR44).

### Instant cameras (Polaroid & Fuji Instax)

Instant cameras develop photos within minutes.
These cameras use self-developing film packs that eject and process automatically.

**Common Manufacturers:**  
- Polaroid (SX-70, 600, Spectra)  
- Fujifilm (Instax Mini, Instax Wide) 

::: details **How to check your camera is functional** 
  - Insert a film pack with a working battery (for Polaroid).
  - Fire the shutter and check if the rollers move.
  - Ensure the flash fires if applicable.

**Vital features to check:**
  - Film compartment should be clean.
  - Ejection mechanism should function correctly.
  - Lens and viewfinder should be free of obstructions.

**Battery type:** 
Older Polaroid cameras use batteries built into the film pack, while newer ones use AA, AAA, or proprietary rechargeable batteries.
:::

### Box cameras

Basic, early 20th-century cameras designed for simplicity.
Uses a fixed-focus lens with minimal controls, often requiring long exposure times.

**Common Manufacturers:**  
- Kodak (Brownie series)  
- Agfa (Box series)  
- Zeiss Ikon (Box Tengor)  

::: details **How to check your camera is functional** 
  - Open the back and check the shutter mechanism.
  - Inspect the lens for cleanliness.
  - Check if the film advance knob turns smoothly.

**Vital features to check:**
  - Shutter should fire and open properly.
  - Lens should be free of major scratches or dirt.
  - Film chamber should be clean and functional.

**Battery type:** 
None (fully mechanical).

## Conclusion

Analogue cameras remain a fascinating and rewarding way to explore photography. 
Whether you find a simple point-and-shoot or a classic SLR, many vintage cameras can still be used today with a little care and maintenance. 
Checking basic functionality before loading film ensures a smooth shooting experience, keeping the magic of film photography alive.
