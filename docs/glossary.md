## Depth of Field  
The range of distances within an image that appear acceptably sharp. 
Depth of field is influenced by three main factors:  

- **Aperture** – A wider aperture (lower f-number) results in a shallower depth of field, while a smaller aperture (higher f-number) increases depth of field.  
- **Focal length** – Longer focal lengths produce a shallower depth of field, whereas shorter focal lengths provide greater depth of field.  
- **Subject distance** – The closer the subject is to the camera, the shallower the depth of field; increasing the distance enhances depth of field.

## Diffraction  
An optical phenomenon that occurs when light waves bend around the edges of an aperture, reducing image sharpness. 
Diffraction becomes more pronounced at very small apertures (high f-numbers), causing fine details to appear softer.  

While stopping down the aperture increases depth of field, excessive diffraction can counteract the benefits by degrading overall resolution. 
The optimal balance between depth of field and sharpness depends on the lens design, film format, and shooting conditions.  

## Push / Pull Processing  
A technique used creatively to achieve specific aesthetic effects or to adapt to challenging lighting conditions.

- **Push processing** involves extending development time to increase contrast and apparent sensitivity, typically used when a film has been underexposed. This can result in increased grain and higher contrast.  
- **Pull processing** reduces development time to lower contrast and compensate for overexposure, often leading to finer grain and reduced density in highlights.

## Shutter Curtain  
A moving component in focal-plane shutter cameras that controls the exposure time by covering and uncovering the film. 
Shutter curtains typically operate in two main types:  

- **Cloth shutter curtain** – Often found in classic rangefinder and SLR cameras, moving horizontally across the film plane.  
- **Metal shutter curtain** – Common in more modern cameras, typically moving vertically for faster shutter speeds.  

The shutter curtain mechanism consists of a first curtain that opens to expose the film and a second curtain that closes to end the exposure. 
The gap between the curtains determines the effective shutter speed.

## Silver halide crystals  
Light-sensitive compounds used in photographic emulsions. 
When exposed to light, silver halide crystals undergo a chemical change that forms the latent image, which is later developed into a visible photograph. 
Common types include silver bromide, silver chloride, and silver iodide, each contributing to the sensitivity and tonal characteristics of the film or photographic paper.  

## Take up spool
A cylindrical component in film cameras that winds the exposed film as it advances through the camera. 
The take-up spool ensures proper film transport, keeping the film taut and preventing overlapping frames. 
In some cameras, it is a fixed part of the film advance mechanism, while in others, it may be removable or integrated into a detachable film cartridge.
