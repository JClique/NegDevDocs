## Backing Paper  
A protective paper strip that wraps around **120 roll film**, shielding it from light and providing frame numbering for various medium format cameras. 
The backing paper extends beyond the film at both ends, allowing for easy loading and secure attachment to the take-up spool.  

Key functions of 120 backing paper include:  

- **Light protection** – Prevents accidental exposure before and after shooting.  
- **Frame markings** – Printed numbers correspond to different format sizes (e.g., 6×4.5, 6×6, 6×7).  
- **Guidance for loading** – Arrows and markings assist in aligning the film correctly in cameras without automatic film counters.  

Unlike **35mm film**, 120 film does not have perforations or a canister, relying entirely on the backing paper for handling and frame registration.  

## Box camera
Simple, fixed-focus cameras with a basic box-shaped design, typically made for affordability and ease of use. 
Box cameras were widely popular from the late 19th to mid-20th century, offering an accessible way for the public to take photographs.  

Key characteristics include:  

- **Fixed-focus lens** – Optimized for subjects at moderate distances.  
- **Single shutter speed and aperture** – Often limited manual controls.  
- **Medium format film** – Many models use 120 or 620 roll film.  

While basic in functionality, box cameras are valued for their vintage charm and soft-focus rendering, making them appealing to collectors and experimental photographers.  

## Depth of field  
The range of distances within an image that appear acceptably sharp. 
Depth of field is influenced by three main factors:  

- **Aperture** – A wider aperture (lower f-number) results in a shallower depth of field, while a smaller aperture (higher f-number) increases depth of field.  
- **Focal length** – Longer focal lengths produce a shallower depth of field, whereas shorter focal lengths provide greater depth of field.  
- **Subject distance** – The closer the subject is to the camera, the shallower the depth of field; increasing the distance enhances depth of field.

## Diffraction  
An optical phenomenon that occurs when light waves bend around the edges of an aperture, reducing image sharpness. 
Diffraction becomes more pronounced at very small apertures (high f-numbers), causing fine details to appear softer.  

While stopping down the aperture increases depth of field, excessive diffraction can counteract the benefits by degrading overall resolution. 
The optimal balance between depth of field and sharpness depends on the lens design, film format, and shooting conditions.  

## Film perforations  
Small, evenly spaced holes along the edges of photographic film that assist with transport and registration in cameras and projectors. 
Perforations ensure smooth film advancement and precise frame positioning.  

Different film formats use distinct perforation patterns:  

- **35mm film** – Features perforations on both edges, with variations such as Kodak Standard (KS) and Bell & Howell (BH) perforations.  
- **16mm and 8mm film** – May have perforations on one or both edges, depending on whether they are single- or double-perforated stocks.  
- **Motion picture film** – Often has specialized perforation types tailored to specific camera and projection systems.  

Film perforations play a crucial role in maintaining consistent frame spacing and stability during exposure and processing.  

## Instant camera 
Cameras designed to produce self-developing photographs moments after exposure, using specialized instant film. 
These cameras contain a built-in developing process that eliminates the need for external processing.  

Key characteristics of instant cameras include:  

- **Integral or peel-apart film** – Modern instant cameras use integral film (e.g., Polaroid, Instax), while older models may use peel-apart film.  
- **Automatic exposure and focus** – Many models are designed for ease of use with minimal manual controls.  
- **Built-in flash** – Often included to accommodate various lighting conditions.  

Instant cameras are popular for their unique aesthetic, immediate results, and nostalgic appeal, making them a favorite for casual and artistic photography.

## Medium format camera  
A camera that uses film or a digital sensor larger than 35mm but smaller than large format (4×5 inches or larger). 
Medium format film typically comes in **120 and 220 roll film** formats, producing negatives with greater detail, dynamic range, and tonal depth compared to 35mm film.  

Common medium format aspect ratios include:  

- **6×4.5 cm (645 format)** – A balance between portability and image quality.  
- **6×6 cm (square format)** – Popular in classic twin-lens reflex (TLR) and modular cameras.  
- **6×7 cm and larger** – Often used in professional studio and landscape photography for their high resolution.  

Medium format cameras are favored for commercial, portrait, and fine art photography due to their superior image quality and distinctive rendering.  

## Point-and-shoot camera  
A compact, user-friendly camera designed for automatic operation with minimal manual controls. 
Point-and-shoot cameras typically feature:  

- **Fixed or zoom lenses** – Often with autofocus and automatic exposure settings.  
- **Built-in flash** – For low-light photography.  
- **Motorized film advance and rewind** – In film models.  

These cameras are popular for casual photography due to their simplicity, portability, and ease of use, making them a convenient option for beginners and everyday shooting.  

## Push / pull processing  
A technique used creatively to achieve specific aesthetic effects or to adapt to challenging lighting conditions.

- **Push processing** involves extending development time to increase contrast and apparent sensitivity, typically used when a film has been underexposed. This can result in increased grain and higher contrast.  
- **Pull processing** reduces development time to lower contrast and compensate for overexposure, often leading to finer grain and reduced density in highlights.

## Rangefinder camera  
A type of camera that uses a rangefinder focusing mechanism, allowing photographers to measure subject distance and achieve precise focus. 
Unlike SLR cameras, rangefinders do not use a reflex mirror; instead, they feature a separate optical viewfinder with a **superimposed focusing patch** that aligns when the subject is in focus.  

Key characteristics include:  

- **Compact, quiet operation** – No mirror slap or blackout during exposure.  
- **Parallax error** – Due to the separation between the viewfinder and the lens, particularly noticeable at close distances.  
- **Interchangeable or fixed lenses** – Many classic rangefinders support high-quality prime lenses.  

Rangefinder cameras are valued for their discreet size, sharp optics, and precise manual focusing, making them popular for street and documentary photography.  

## Shutter curtain  
A moving component in focal-plane shutter cameras that controls the exposure time by covering and uncovering the film. 
Shutter curtains typically operate in two main types:  

- **Cloth shutter curtain** – Often found in classic rangefinder and SLR cameras, moving horizontally across the film plane.  
- **Metal shutter curtain** – Common in more modern cameras, typically moving vertically for faster shutter speeds.  

The shutter curtain mechanism consists of a first curtain that opens to expose the film and a second curtain that closes to end the exposure. 
The gap between the curtains determines the effective shutter speed.

## Silver halide crystals  
Light-sensitive compounds used in photographic emulsions. 
When exposed to light, silver halide crystals undergo a chemical change that forms the latent image, which is later developed into a visible photograph. 
Common types include silver bromide, silver chloride, and silver iodide, each contributing to the sensitivity and tonal characteristics of the film or photographic paper.  

## SLR camera  
A **Single-Lens Reflex (SLR) camera** is a type of camera that uses a mirror and prism system to allow the photographer to view the scene directly through the taking lens. 
This provides an accurate representation of framing, focus, and depth of field.  

Key characteristics of SLR cameras include:  

- **Interchangeable lenses** – Offering versatility for different types of photography.  
- **Optical viewfinder** – Uses a pentaprism or pentamirror to direct the image to the photographer’s eye.  
- **Reflex mirror mechanism** – Flips up during exposure, allowing light to reach the film or sensor.  

## Take up spool
A cylindrical component in film cameras that winds the exposed film as it advances through the camera. 
The take-up spool ensures proper film transport, keeping the film taut and preventing overlapping frames. 
In some cameras, it is a fixed part of the film advance mechanism, while in others, it may be removable or integrated into a detachable film cartridge.
