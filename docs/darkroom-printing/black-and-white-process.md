# Black & white darkroom printing

Making a black & white darkroom print is one of the most rewarding processes in analogue photography. Using an enlarger, you project your film negative onto light-sensitive photographic paper, exposing it to create a latent image. With care, patience, and a bit of trial and error, you can make a finished print by hand—revealing your image through light, chemistry, and craft.

## How darkroom printing works

At its core, printing a photograph in the darkroom is similar to exposing a photo in-camera. 
In both cases, light passes through a lens, striking a light-sensitive surface. 
When making a darkroom print, however, you're working with an enlarger instead of a camera, and with photographic paper instead of film.

The enlarger acts like a reversed camera. A light source inside the enlarger shines through your negative, and a lens focuses that image onto the paper below. 
This forms a latent image by exposing the [silver halides](/glossary#silver-halide-crystals) within the paper, which only becomes visible once developed in chemicals.

### Chemical process

The developing process typically involves three chemical stages, each in its own tray making it easy to move the print from one bath to another.

**Developer**: Brings out the latent image, converting the exposed silver halides into metallic silver. 
- Time: 1–2 minutes 
- Notes: Time varies based on temperature and paper type. Agitate gently and keep time consistent between prints.

**Stop bath**: Halts development immediately. 
- Time: 10–30 seconds 
- Notes: A short rinse to neutralise the developer and prepare the paper for fixing.

**Fixer**: Makes the image permanent and light-safe.
- Time: 2–5 minutes
- Notes: Ensures the image is fully fixed and archival. Agitate gently to prevent uneven fixing. For test prints or strips, a shorter fixing time can help speed up the process.

## Determine exposure settings

There are two main ways to control how much light reaches the paper: aperture and exposure time.

The aperture is the opening inside the enlarger’s lens, and exposure time is how long the light is on. These two settings work together to determine the final print’s exposure. 

::: warning
Avoid changing the height of the enlarger after you’ve started making test strips or prints. Even a small adjustment will alter both the image size and exposure, requiring you to start again.

### Aperture

Unlike in-camera exposure, the aperture in darkroom printing has less creative effect. It mainly controls how much light is projected, and can slightly affect sharpness due to lens performance.

For simplicity, beginner printers should stop the lens down two stops from wide open. This improves sharpness without requiring long exposures.

### Exposure time

A timer connected to the enlarger switches the light on and off precisely. Most darkrooms use a digital or mechanical timer to set exposures in seconds.

To determine the right exposure, we use **test strips**—small sections of paper exposed at different times to find the best result. To make one:

1. Cut a piece of photographic paper into a strip.
2. Place it under the enlarger where your image will be.
3. Cover most of the strip with card or black paper.
4. Expose the first section (e.g. 2 seconds), then slide the cover to reveal the next section.
5. Repeat until several sections have been exposed for increasing times (e.g. 2, 4, 6, 8 seconds).

After developing the strip, you can compare each section to see which exposure gives the best result.

::: tip
We use an [enlarger exposure scale](http://localhost:5173/darkroom-printing/equipment-and-materials#exposure-printing-scale) in place of traditional test strips in our community darkroom. 
This helps reduce paper waste and helps keep test prints labelled and easy to understand.

## Printing workflow

The diagram below provides a visual overview of the darkroom printing process for black and white photographs. 
It maps out the key stages involved, from selecting a negative to producing a final print, and highlights how each step connects to the next. 
This workflow is designed to help you understand the sequence of actions, and the role of creative decision-making along the way.

Notes such as “Increase exposure” or “Decrease contrast fade” are intended as helpful prompts rather than precise instructions—they should be approached with your best judgement based on the image you’re printing and the results you’re seeing.

Once you’ve made a final print you’re happy with, decide how many copies to make. It’s easier to make extra prints now, while your enlarger and settings are dialled in, than trying to recreate the same print later.

In the next section, we'll explore how to wash and dry prints to ensure they last for decades to come.
