# Preparing an enlarger

This guide will walk you through the steps of loading a negative into an enlarger, preparing it for focusing and framing. 
Every enlarger is a little different, but the basic process remains the same. 
Take your time and handle your negatives with care to avoid scratches or dust.

## Loading the enlarger

### What is a negative carrier?

The negative carrier is the part of the enlarger that holds your film in place. 
It sandwiches the negative between two pieces of glass or metal and ensures it stays flat and properly aligned during exposure.

Negative carriers vary in design depending on the enlarger model—some are hinged, others come apart completely. 
Always make sure the carrier matches the film format you're using (e.g. 35mm, 120), and is compatible with the enlarger being used.

### Loading your negative

1. **Inspect the carrier** – Make sure it's clean and free of dust. Use an air blower or anti-static cloth if needed.  
2. **Open the carrier** – Depending on your enlarger, this might mean unlocking a hinge or separating two pieces.  
3. **Position the negative** – Carefully place your negative so the image is centred and the emulsion side is facing down (towards the enlarger lens).  
4. **Close and secure** – Gently close the carrier, checking that the negative remains in position. Clip or latch it shut as required.  
5. **Insert the carrier into the enlarger head** – Align it properly so the negative lies flat in the path of the enlarger light.  

Take a moment to double-check for dust or fingerprints on the negative before continuing.

## Adjusting the enlarger

### Enlarger controls

Most enlargers have two main dials to help with focusing and framing. 
One dial raises or lowers the enlarger head, which changes the size of the projected image. 
The other dial adjusts the position of the lens board, moving it closer to or farther from the negative to bring the image into focus.

### Focusing and framing your image

1. **Turn off any filters** – Remove any contrast or colour filters for now. Set the enlarger lens to its widest aperture to allow the most light through.  
2. **Project the image onto the baseboard** – Raise or lower the enlarger head until the image is approximately the size you want to print.  
3. **Use a focusing aid** – If you have one, place a grain focuser or loupe on the baseboard in the area you want sharpest. Adjust the focus until you can clearly see the film grain.
4. **Adjust framing** – Use your easel or masking tools to crop the image as desired, making sure the paper area is evenly illuminated.  
5. **Double-check everything** – Make sure the image is in focus, framed correctly, and that nothing has shifted during the process.  

Once you’re happy with focus and framing, you’re ready to move on to exposure and test strips.
