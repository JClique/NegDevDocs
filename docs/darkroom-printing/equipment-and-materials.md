# Equipment and materials

Darkroom printing requires a few essential tools. 
Beyond the basics, additional equipment can make the process easier, more consistent, or more enjoyable.

## Required tools

### Enlarger & timer
An enlarger is used to project light through a negative and onto light-sensitive paper, allowing you to create a photographic print. 
Different models are designed to handle different negative sizes, offering flexibility depending on the format you're working with.

A timer connects to the enlarger to control the duration of exposure. 
Accurate timing is crucial for producing consistent results and is an essential part of the darkroom workflow.

### Darkroom printing paper
The choice of darkroom printing paper significantly affects the final print quality and the overall look and feel of your image. 

Paper is typically available in two main types: resin coated (RC) and fibre based (FB). 
RC papers are easier and faster to process and dry, making them ideal for quick results and everyday printing. 
FB papers offer greater depth and richness in tone but require longer washing and drying times. 

Both types come in a variety of surfaces, including glossy, matte, and satin, each providing different aesthetic results and textures.

### Developing trays
Developing trays are essential for holding the chemicals used in the printing process. 
They come in various sizes and materials, allowing for the efficient processing of multiple prints simultaneously while ensuring the chemicals are contained safely.

## Helpful tools

These tools are not essential but make darkroom printing **easier and more efficient**.

### Easel
The easel plays an important role in holding the paper flat during exposure. 
Different types of easels are available, contributing to the precision and alignment of the print for a professional finish.

### Print tongues
Print tongues are designed to handle prints during development, preventing contact with the paper's surface. 
This helps avoid damage or fingerprints, ensuring the integrity of each print is maintained.

### Focus finder
Focus finders are instrumental in achieving sharp focus when enlarging a negative onto the paper. 
Various types are available, ensuring the image is accurately projected for optimal clarity.

### Timer/clock
Using a timer or clock can be useful during the darkroom printing process as it help control the chemical processing time.
This promotes consistency in results, making it easier to replicate successful prints.

### Drying rack
The drying process is essential for preserving print quality, with various methods available, including air drying and specialised dryers. 
Proper drying techniques help prevent damage and ensure the longevity of the prints.

### Dodging/burning tools
Dodging and burning tools are used to selectively alter the exposure of specific areas of the print. 
These tools are critical for fine-tuning contrast and highlights, enhancing the overall visual impact of the image.

### Easel
The easel plays a critical role in holding the paper flat during exposure. 
Different types of easels are available, contributing to the precision and alignment of the print for a professional finish.

### Exposure printing scale
An exposure printing scale helps you find the right exposure time for your darkroom print. 
It works by placing a step wedge—a strip with areas of varying darkness—under the enlarger light and exposing it onto photo paper. 
The resulting print shows how different exposure times affect the paper. 
By examining this print, you can quickly estimate the best exposure time for your negative.
This tool us useful for getting accurate prints quickly, reducing paper waste during test prints and keeping your results consistent across multiple sessions.

## Luxury tools 

For those who print frequently, these tools provide extra convenience and precision. 

### Print dryer
A print dryer is a luxury tool that expedites the drying process while preventing dust and debris from settling on the prints. 
It creates a controlled environment for quicker, cleaner results.

### Print processor
The print processor automates the chemical development process, greatly improving efficiency and consistency in high-volume printing setups. 
This tool is ideal for those who frequently produce large quantities of prints, especially RA4 where the chemistry does not lend itself to open-tray developing.
