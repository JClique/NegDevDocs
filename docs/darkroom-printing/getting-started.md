# A beginner’s guide to darkroom printing

Bringing a photograph to life in the darkroom is a hands-on process that blends creativity with technique. 
This guide introduces the fundamentals, offering practical advice to help you make high-quality prints consistently. 

## What is darkroom printing?

Darkroom printing is the process of creating photographic prints using light-sensitive paper, a chemical development process, and an enlarger. 
The process involves projecting an image from a film negative onto photographic paper, then processing it using chemical baths to reveal the final print.

### Understanding paper and negative combinations

The chemistry necessary to process a print depends on both the type of photographic paper and the negative used. Each process is covered in depth within this documentation.

**Black & white** prints are made by projecting black & white negatives onto black & white photographic paper. 
This combination produces a black & white positive image. 
The print is developed using a process similar to black & white film, involving three chemical baths: developer, stop bath, and fix.

**RA4 C-type** prints are made by projecting colour negatives (typically C41 processed film) onto RA4 colour paper. 
This combination results in a full-colour positive print. 
The process requires a colour developer, followed by either separate bleach and fix baths or a combined bleach-fix solution.

## Why darkroom print?

Unlike digital printing, which relies on ink or laser technology, darkroom printing allows for hands-on control over the final image through exposure and development techniques. 
Many find the process itself rewarding—working with their hands and engaging in a tactile, meditative craft. 

In the darkroom, light exposes [silver halides](/glossary#silver-halide-crystals) within the emulsion layer of the photographic paper, creating a latent image just like film.
Developing the print makes the image visible by converting exposed silver halides into metallic silver (for black & white prints) or forming dye layers (for colour prints). 

The relationship between the silver halides in the negative and the paper gives darkroom prints rich, organic tones and textures that digital methods struggle to replicate.

## How to darkroom print

### Creating a home darkroom

Setting up a darkroom at home requires a dedicated space that can be made completely light-tight. 
A spare room or bathroom can be temporarily adapted using blackout fabric or seals to block any stray light. 
With careful planning, even a small space can be transformed into a functional darkroom.

::: warning ⚠ **Safety first** 
Creating a home darkroom can be a simple process as long as some basic [safety guidelines](/appendix/darkroom-safety) are followed.

### Printing in a community space

For those who don't have access to a home setup, community darkrooms provide an excellent alternative. 
These shared spaces are equipped with professional tools, allowing photographers to focus on refining their craft without the expense of setting up their own darkroom. 

::: info Visit our community darkroom!
Our community darkroom is designed to provide a welcoming and well-equipped environment for both beginners and experienced printers, offering workshops, support, and access to high-quality printing facilities.
